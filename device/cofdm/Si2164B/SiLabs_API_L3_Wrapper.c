/* Last  changes:

  As from V2.5.6:
    <improvement>[DVB_S2/status]   In SiLabs_API_Demod_status_selection: storing status->num_is and status->isi_id when locked in DVB_S2,
                                     setting status->s2x to 1 if locked in a DVB-S2X MODCODE combination
                                   In SiLabs_API_Text_status_selection: filling text with status->num_is and status->isi_id values when locked in DVB_S2

    <improvement>[SLEEP/ANALOG]    In SiLabs_API_lock_to_carrier: returning 1 after calling SiLabs_API_switch_to_standard in ANALOG or SLEEP modes.
    <improvement>[SOC_EVB/Si2165D] In SiLabs_API_Demod_status_selection for Si2165D: setting ber_mant/ber_exp based on status->ber, to allow proper BER display
     using SiLabs_API_Text_status_selection.
    <improvement>[GPIF/Cypress] In SiLabs_API_TS_Mode: not using the result of the check on '-gpif', since it doesn't return the proper value.
    <new_feature>[Cypress/streaming] In SiLabs_API_TS_Mode: allowing SILABS_TS_STREAMING option, to configure TS streaming independently from the demod settings
    <new_feature>[SAT/TAG] In Silabs_API_Test: adding 'sat_tag' option

  As from V2.5.5:

    <correction>[ATV/TEXT status] In SiLabs_API_TER_Tuner_ATV_Text_status: enabling/disabling i2c to execute TER tuner status
    <improvement>[SAT/LNB] In SiLabs_API_SAT_voltage: calling the L1_xxxx_InitAfterReset function for LNBH25, LNBH26 and LNBH29.
       (other LNB chips don't need this, since all registers are written for each call)
    <new_feature>[TS_spurs]
      Adding SiLabs_API_Get_TS_Dividers to retrieve the TS clock dividers (only supported by Si2164B with recent FWs (above 5_0b13) )
      Adding Silabs_API_TS_Tone_Cancel  to activate the Tone cancellation in the TER tuner (only supported by Si2190B initially)
    <improvement>[Duals/SiLabs_EVBs] In SiLabs_API_SW_Init: surrounding ts_mux related code by USB_Capability, since it's only valid on some SiLabs EVBs

  As from V2.5.1:
    <correction>  [status/BER] In SiLabs_API_Demod_status_selection: Swapping dd_ber_resol exp and mant for Si2164/83 for exp=7 and mant=1 (in place of exp=1 mant=7)
    <improvement>[TERACOM/BER] In SiLabs_API_Demod_status_selection: Changing BER settings when locked in DVB-T (1;6) vs other standards (1;7).
              This is to improve measurement accuracy for BER criteria.
    <improvement> [status/return value] In SiLabs_API_Demod_status_selection: returning 1 when status function meets no problem.
    <new_feature>[TER_Tuner/Config]
      Adding SiLabs_API_TER_Tuner_FEF_Input to allow configuration of the TER tuner FEF input. This needs to be added to the configuration macros.
      The default value is '1' to select GPIO1 on the TER tuner side.
    <improvement>[cleanup] In SiLabs_API_TER_Tuner_ATV_Tune: removing invert_spectrum
   <improvement/compatibility>
	   In SiLabs_API_SAT_Possible_LNB_Chips: Setting i to avoid warning when not used.
     In SiLabs_API_Select_PLP: Setting plp_id and plp_mode to avoid warning when not used.
     In SiLabs_API_TER_Tuner_ATV_Tune: Setting all variables to avoid warnings when not used.
     In Silabs_API_Test: using standard to avoid warning when not used.
    <correction>  [constel/DVB-S2X] In Silabs_constelCode and Custom_constelCode: Adding DVB-S2-X specific constellations.

  As from 2.5.0:
   <improvement>[status/ISDBT] Adding partial_flag in _CUSTOM_Status_Struct
    In SiLabs_API_Demod_status_selection: storing partial flag information in status->partial_flag.
   <new_feature>[Test_Pipe/init_ok] In Silabs_API_Test: adding 'init_ok' to know if demod init is done
   <new feature>[TER_Tuner/Config]
     adding SiLabs_API_TER_Tuner_Block_VCO2 and SiLabs_API_TER_Tuner_Block_VCO3 to allow configuration of
     the TER_Tuner block_VCO2_code and block_VCO3_code
   <new_feature>[I2C/Tuners_Direct] In SiLabs_API_XXX_Tuner_I2C_Enable/SiLabs_API_XXX_Tuner_I2C_Enable: using a special value (100) to allow
    having direct connection to tuners (without demod pass-through).
    API CONFIG in such case:
     SiLabs_API_TER_tuner_I2C_connection(front_end, 100);
     SiLabs_API_SAT_tuner_I2C_connection(front_end, 100);
   <new_feature>[Test_Pipe/LNBH26] In Silabs_API_Test: adding 'lnbh26' 'a_b' '0/1' option to select which LNB controller is used (LNBH26 is a dual)
   <new_feature>[CONFIG/tracing] In all configuration functions: storing all configuration fields in SILABS_FE_Context (to enable configuration checking after init).
      NB: This allows removing some previous code used to avoid compilation warnings, since all fields are not used.
      Adding SiLabs_API_Config_Infos. This function is useful to check the configuration parameters based on the related function name.
        Use "Full" for the function name to get the entire configuration.

  As from V2.4.9:
   <improvement/Duals> Adding demod_die in _CUSTOM_Status_Struct
    In SiLabs_API_Demod_status_selection: storing demod die information in status->demod_die.
    In SiLabs_API_Text_status_selection:  adding die information to status text.
   <typo/T2_lock_mode> In SiLabs_API_lock_to_carrier comments: T2_lock_mode is independent of num_lp.
     Parameter: T2_lock_mode        the DVB-T2 lock mode        (0='ANY', 1='T2-Base', 2='T2-Lite')
     <typo/ISDB-T> In SiLabs_API_lock_to_carrier comments: bandwidth_Hz is also used for ISDB-T
     Parameter: bandwidth_Hz        the channel bandwidth in Hz (only for DVB-T, DVB-T2, ISDB-T)
   <correction/Duals> In SiLabs_API_Demods_Kickstart: directly setting demods to their final clock input.
    NB: For duals (Si216x2), the clock source should not change between TER and SAT, and the clock should be 'always-on':
      In calls to SiLabs_API_TER_Clock/SiLabs_API_SAT_Clock: use identical settings and force 'clock_control = 1'.

  As from V2.4.8:
   <new_part/A8293/LNB_Supply> Compatibility with Allegro's A8293 (needs A8293_COMPATIBLE)

  As from V2.4.7:
   <improvement/Settings> In SiLabs_API_Demod_status_selection: Saving status->IFagc depending on the AGC in use.
                           Previous versions assumed that AGC1 for SAT and AGC2 for TER. This restriction doesn't apply anymore.
   <improvement/compatibility> Changing all C++ comments to C style
                               In SiLabs_API_SAT_Tuner_status:      setting sat_tuner by default to avoid compiler warnings.
                               In SiLabs_API_TER_Tuner_ClockConfig: setting tuner_ter by default to avoid compiler warnings.
                               In SiLabs_API_TS_Mode:               moving SiTRACE after all variables are declared.
                               In SiLabs_API_SAT_AutoDetectCheck :  moving SiTRACE after all variables are declared.
   <improvement/NO_FLOAT> Adding SiLabs_API_SSI_SQI_no_float and Silabs_Log10_10000 to enable SSI and SQI computing when
                            not done by FW and when using floats is not allowed.
   <correction/BER> In SiLabs_API_Demod_status_selection:
                       storing ber_exp+1 in status->ber_exp.
                       storing per_exp+1 in status->per_exp.
                       storing fer_exp+1 in status->fer_exp.
                    In rate_f_mant_exp: exp treated to match the changes in SiLabs_API_Demod_status_selection.
   <correction/RSSI/Si2167B> In SiLabs_API_Demod_status_selection: Calling SAT_TUNER_RSSI_FROM_IFAGC for Si2167B in SAT

  As from V2.4.6:
   <improvement>[TERACOM/BER] In SiLabs_API_Demod_status_selection: Changing BER settings when locked in DVB-T (5;8) vs other standards (1;7). ONLY for Si2164B.
   <improvement>[DUALS/XTAL]  In SiLabs_API_Demods_Kickstart: Using TUNE_CAP_15P6 and CLK_MODE_XTAL to make sure demodulators are not pulling
    the clock input pin low.

  As from V2.4.4:
    <new_feature>[TER_Tuner/Config]
     Adding SiLabs_API_TER_Tuner_AGC_Input and SiLabs_API_TER_Tuner_IF_Output to allow configuration of the
       TER tuner IF output and AGC input
    <improvement>[STATUS/selection] In SiLabs_API_Demod_status_selection:
       Forcing flags to 1 if status_selection is 0x00, to allow compatibility for applications calling this
        function directly

  As from V2.4.3:
   <improvement> In SiLabs_API_TS_Mode: removing TS parallel shape setup for Si2164B.
                  Only keeping values of '7070' for GPIF mode.
                  GPIF mode is only used with SiLabs EVBs and is never used together with serial or parallel.

  As from V2.4.2
   <correction> [Si2164A/Si2169B/Si2168B/DVBT2_C/N] In SiLabs_API_Demod_status_selection:
   Correctly setting status->c_n to dvbt2_status.cnr/4.0 for the related parts.
   <correction>[TS_Crossbar] TS crossbar feature now working (with duals with this capability) as from FW 4_ab4

  As from V2.4.1
   <improvement>[Si2167B] In Silabs_coderateCode/Custom_coderateCode: tags changed to allow export for Si21652B
   <new_feature> [ISDB-T/LAYER] Adding SiLabs_API_TER_ISDBT_Monitoring_mode property to select the layer used
    for BER, CBER, PER, and UNCOR monitoring in ISDB-T
   <improvement> [TUNER_STATUS] In SiLabs_API_FE_status_selection: only tracing RSSI and freq if tuner status has been done
               Not returning anymore if the standard is unknown, to allow AGC monitoring.

  As from V2.4.0:
   <new_feature> [tag/level] adding tag and level support for Si2167B and derivatives
   <improvement> [Unicable/Multi-Treading/Multiple frontends] In SiLabs_API_SAT_Tuner_Tune: removing I2C pass-through enable/disable.
    This is only called while tuning in Unicable, and the i2c pass-through is already enabled when calling this function.
    The change removes nested i2c pass-through enable/disable calls.
    This is generally not an issue, unless several tuners are using the same i2c address and the application is multi-threading.

  As from V2.3.9:
   <new_parts> Status updated for ISDB-T support

  As from V2.3.8:
    <new_feature> Using STRING_APPEND_SAFE macro (defined in Si_I2C V3.4.5) for Linux compatibility.

  As from V2.3.7:
    <new_parts> [Si2164B] Adding Si2164B support
    <new_standard> [ISDB-T] Adding support for ISDB-T
    <new_feature> [DVB-S2X] Adding Constellation and code rate functions for DVB-S2X.
    <new_feature> [TAG/LEVEL] Adding definitions for TAG and level
                Adding SiLabs_API_Set_Index_and_Tag
    <new_feature> Using STRING_APPEND_SAFE macro (defined in Si_I2C V3.4.5) for Linux compatibility.

  As from V2.3.6:
    <correction> [LNBH29] In SiLabs_API_SAT_Select_LNB_Chip: using lnb_code 29 to select LNBH29
    <new_feature> [STATUS/SELECTION] Adding SiLabs_API_Demod_status_selection / SiLabs_API_FE_status_selection / SiLabs_API_Text_status_selection.
            The behavior when calling SiLabs_API_Demod_status / SiLabs_API_FE_status_ / SiLabs_API_Text_status is unchanged, since these call the new functions
              with the value '0x00' which means 'status all items'
            These can be used to status only a portion of the CUSTOM_Status_Struct, depending on a status_selection bit field, using the following bit flags:
              FE_LOCK_STATE     : demod_lock, fec_lock,  uncorrs, TS_bitrate_kHz, TS_clock_kHz
              FE_LEVELS         : RSSI, RFagc, IFagc
              FE_RATES          : BER, PER, FER (depending on standard)
              FE_SPECIFIC       : symbol_rate, stream, constellation, c/n, freq_offset, timing_offset, code_rate, t2_version,
                                  num_plp, plp_id, ds_id, cell_id, etc (generally one function called per standard).
              FE_QUALITY        : SSI, SQI
              FE_FREQ           : freq
    <new_feature> [SW_CONFIG] Adding SiLabs_API_Frontend_Chip / SiLabs_API_TER_tuner_I2C_connection / SiLabs_API_SAT_tuner_I2C_connection
            These will be used instead of direct access to the L3 context values.
            They also allow easier access from the top level, and allow configuring the GUI using script files.
    <improvement> [T2/C2/MPLP/SEEK] In SiLabs_API_Channel_Seek_Next: if locked, updating value of front_end->standard.
            This removes the need to call SiLabs_API_Demod_status to update this value, which is used when retrieving the plp_ids and ds_ids.
    <improvement> [portability] In SiLabs_API_SSI_SQI: moving code after all declarations, because this creates compilation errors with some compilers.
    <improvement> [portability/NO_FLOATS_ALLOWED] In status functions, store information as rate_mant/rate_exp for ber/per/fer,
              and use these instead of the double fields.
    <improvement> [renaming] SiLabs_API_TER_FEF_CONFIG renamed as SiLabs_API_TER_FEF_Config, for consistency with other configuration functions.
    <improvement> [traces] Adding dedicated trace messages to help trace wrapper function calls:
      'API CALL CONFIG' for SW configuration functions, formatted as in configurations macros.
            These will be useful to check the SW configuration in the traces, and create the corresponding configuration macros.
      'API CALL SEEK'   for scan-related functions
      'API CALL INIT'   for init-related functions
      'API CALL LOCK'   for lock-related functions
      'API CALL STATUS' for statusing functions
    <improvement> [DVB-T2] In SiLabs_API_Demod_status: statusing status->t2_system_id
    <improvement> [Si2164/ANALOG] In Silabs_standardCode: Adding 'ANALOG' value for Si2164.

*/
/* Older changes:

  As from V2.3.5:
    <new_feature> [Si2164/SPI) Adding SiLabs_API_SPI_Setup (Only available with Si2164 derivatives as from today)
       CAUTION1: In any case, this requires updating the following item to support SPI download:
        - SiLabs_L0 source code. The SPI support functions also need to be ported to your platform(s)
       CAUTION2: When used with SiLabs EVBs, this requires updating the following items to support SPI download using the Cypress chip:
        - Cypress FW
        - Cypress DLL
      Adding SiLabs_API_SPI_Setup
    <improvement> [code_checkers] In text-oriented functions using sprintf:
      Replacing sprintf by snprintf with a max size at 1000, as this is safer.
      The only constraint is that the text strings need to be declared with a minimum size of 1000 bytes.
      This should be enough to pass through code checkers.
    <comments> In SiLabs_API_TER_Tuner_ClockConfig: documenting input parameters use

  As from V2.3.4:
    <new_feature> [TER TUNER/Multi-frontend] Adding SiLabs_API_TER_Tuner_ClockConfig, to easily configure the TER tuner clock:
    signed int   SiLabs_API_TER_Tuner_ClockConfig    (SILABS_FE_Context *front_end, signed int xtal, signed int xout);
     xtal = 1: a Xtal is connected to and driven by the TER tuner.
     xtal = 0: a clock signal is connected to the TER tuner, which doesn't drive a Xtal.
     xout = 1: the clock is going out of the TER tuner.
     xout = 0: no  clock is going out of the TER tuner.

  As from V2.3.3:
    <new feature> [handshake] Adding SiLabs_API_Handshake_Setup, to easily control the handshake parameters from the wrapper level
    <new feature> [Si2164] Adding SiLabs_API_TER_T2_lock_mode, to select the T2 lock mode. It can be used to select the T2 lock mode during channel Seek.
                   This avoids the need to add a parameter to Seek_Init

  As from V2.3.2:
    <new feature> [Si21x8 tuners] Adding SiLabs_API_TER_Broadcast_I2C, useful to enable the broadcast i2c feature (only available with Si21x8B tuners)
    <improvement> [AUTO_T_T2] In SiLabs_API_Demod_status: setting front_end->standard to match status->standard when locked.
                   This is useful for SiLabs_API_Get_PLP_ID_and_TYPE when in AUTO_T_T2 and locked on a T2 signal:
                    if front_end->standard is left as 'SILABS_DVB_T' the function returns 0 while it needs to call Si216x_L1_DVBT2_PLP_INFO
    <new feature> [MCNS] In SiLabs_API_Demod_status: adding MCNS support

  As from  V2.3.1:
    <correction>  In SiLabs_API_TS_Mode:
     Correcting the 'SILABS_TS_TRISTATE' case to use the 'TRISTATE' mode
     Adding  SILABS_TS_OFF in CUSTOM_TS_Mode_Enum structure
     Adding 'SILABS_TS_OFF' case for Si2164/Si2167B/Si2169A
    <correction> In SiLabs_API_DEMOD_Status:
      Adding the SILABS_MCNS case
    <new feature> Adding 'signed int clock_control' to SiLabs_API_TER_Clock and SiLabs_API_SAT_Clock prototypes.
      This is used for multi-frontends applications when a tuner's clock is forwarded to another frontend.
        In this case it needs to be 'ALWAYS_ON'.
        To keep the previous behavior, use '2' (i.e. the 'MANAGED' mode)
      Adding the corresponding code in:
       SiLabs_API_TER_Clock_Options/SiLabs_API_TER_Clock
       SiLabs_API_SAT_Clock_Options/SiLabs_API_SAT_Clock
    <new feature> In SiLabs_API_SAT_Clock_Options: adding Si2167B
    <new_feature> Adding t2_version monitoring and related functions

  As from V2.3.0:
    Reverting changes to constellation type in SiLabs_API_lock_to_carrier function, as this forbids using the value of '-1' as SILABS_QAMAUTO.
    Using 'unsigned char constellation' broke the DVB-C AUTO qam capability.

    SiLabs_API_lock_to_carrier prototype is now:
    signed int   SiLabs_API_lock_to_carrier (SILABS_FE_Context *front_end,
                                       unsigned char standard,
                                                 signed int freq,
                                                 signed int bandwidth_Hz,
                                       unsigned char stream,
                                       unsigned int  symbol_rate_bps,
                                                char constellation,
                                       unsigned char polarization,
                                       unsigned char band,
                                                 signed int data_slice_id,
                                                 signed int plp_id,
                                       unsigned char T2_lock_mode);

  As from V2.2.9:
    In Custom_giCode / Silabs_giCode / Silabs_GI_Text:
     Adding 1/64 GI code handling (for DVB-C2)
    Adding lnb_chip_address to SILABS_FE_Context
    Adding SiLabs_API_TER_FEF_Options and SiLabs_API_TER_FEF_Config functions, to allow different FEF configuration depending on the frontend.
     This is required when using dual demodulators, where there are restrictions on MP_x and GPIOx pin usage.
    Changing SiLabs_API_SAT_Select_LNB_Chip function definition to add the lnb chip address.
     This is required for multi-frontend SAT applications.
    Changing SiLabs_API_switch_to_standard and SiLabs_API_set_standard function definitions to use 'unsigned char' instead of 'signed int' for standard.
    Changing SiLabs_API_lock_to_carrier function definition to use 'unsigned char' instead of 'signed int' for standard/stream/constellation/polarization/band/T2_lock_Mode.
     This avoids casting the related values to (unsigned int) within the functions.
      data_slice_id and plp_id are kept as 'signed int', as they may take a value of '-1' at wrapper level to select the corresponding 'auto' modes.
    In SiLabs_API_Demod_status:
     Adding one SiTRACE right after DD_STATUS, to trace the demod address (useful in multi-front-ends), the lock state and the standard.
    In SiLabs_API_Demod_status/SiLabs_API_SAT_Tuner_status/SiLabs_API_SAT_Tuner_Tune/SiLabs_API_TER_Tuner_Init/SiLabs_API_TER_Tuner_Text_status/SiLabs_API_TER_Tuner_ATV_Tune/SiLabs_API_TER_Tuner_Block_VCO:
     Changing I2C Enable/Disable calls to use the TER and SAT indirect i2c enable/disable calls, to allow tuner rssi statusing if INDIRECT_I2C_CONNECTION is used
     In SiLabs_API_SAT_Tuner_I2C_Enable and SiLabs_API_TER_Tuner_I2C_Enable:
      Replacing 'count' by 'fe_count', as 'count' may be a reserved word in some implementations.
     In SiLabs_API_SAT_Tuner_I2C_Enable and SiLabs_API_SAT_Tuner_I2C_Disable:
      Correcting code to properly connect the required i2c pass-through (previously only working for the SAT tuner on frontend 0 only).
    In SiLabs_API_FE_status:
     Directly tracing freq and tuner rssi before calling SiLabs_API_Demod_status.
    In SiLabs_API_Text_status:
     Adding config_code to text status. This is useful to knwo which frontend is statused in multi-frontend applications
    In SiLabs_API_SSI_SQI:

    Adding Silabs_T2_Base_Lite_Text function.
    In SiLabs_API_Text_status:
      Adding T2 base/lite text for T2
      Added MCNS in frequency display. MCNS text status didn't fill entirely due to this.
      Reduced code for frequency diplay.
    In SiLabs_API_TER_Clock / SiLabs_API_TER_AGC : adding tags to remove code for non-TER parts
    In SiLabs_API_SAT_Clock / SiLabs_API_SAT_AGC / SiLabs_API_SAT_Spectrum : adding tags to remove code for non-SAT parts

  As from V2.2.7:
    In SiLabs_API_Get_PLP_ID_and_TYPE: comparing standards value to SILABS_DVB_T2.
     (previously using Si2164_DD_MODE_PROP_MODULATION_DVBT2, which is incorrect at wrapper level).
    In SiLabs_API_TER_Clock: correction of Si2165 text related to clock source pin numbers
    In SiLabs_API_TER_AGC: correction of code used for Si2165

  As from V2.2.6:
    In SILABS_FE_Context structure: Adding config_code, used to store the i2c addresses of the TER tuner (bits[23:16]), the SAT tuner (bits[15:8]) the demod (bits[7:0]).
      This is used to know which path is controlled in multi-frontend applications, even when not tracing L0 bytes.
    In SiLabs_API_Channel_Seek_Next:   Adding T2_base_lite flag
    In SiLabs_API_Channel_Seek_Next:   Adding T2_base_lite flag  (indicates whether the locked signal is T2-Base or T2-Lite)
    In SiLabs_API_SAT_Select_LNB_Chip: Returning front_end->lnb_chip if OK, 0 otherwise. This compiles correctly for non-SAT products.
    In SiLabs_API_lock_to_carrier:     Adding T2_lock_mode flag (selects whether to lock on the T2-Base or T2-Lite signal (o='any'))
    In SiLabs_API_Tune:                Compatibility with Si2169B
    In SiLabs_API_Get_PLP_ID_and_TYPE: Adding C2 compatibility (for Si2164)

    In SiLabs_API_TER_Tuner_Block_VCO:       Compatibility with SiLabs_TER_Tuner wrapper
    WARNING: The latest TER tuners are NOT supported if not using the SiLabs_TER_Tuner wrapper
    In SiLabs_API_SSI_SQI: Adding C2 SSI SQI

  As from V2.2.5:
    In SiLabs_API_SSI_SQI: added DVB-C capability
    In SiLabs_API_Demod_status: calling SiLabs_API_SSI_SQI whenever SSI/SQI values haven't been set earlier.
      (the latest demodulators will have the SSI/SQI feature implemented in FW, and SiLabs_API_Demod_status will use the FW function if this is the case)
      Updating value of status->TS_clock_kHz for Si2165

  As from V2.2.4:
    In SiLabs_API_SAT_Tuner_status: compatibilty with SILABS_SAT_TUNER_API

    Si2167B compatibility with TER and SAT configuration

  As from V2.2.2:
   SILABS_SAT_TUNER_API compatibility (the only way to work with Si2164):
    Adding SiLabs_API_Select_SAT_Tuner function, useful to select the SAT tuner for each demodulator
    Adding SiLabs_API_SAT_Address function, useful to set the I2C address of any TER tuner
    Adding SiLabs_API_SAT_Clock and SiLabs_API_SAT_AGC functions, to configure the clock paths (source, input, freq) and AGC.
     NB: This only works if matching functions are added to the demodulator code.
     NB: In this first version, these functions only support SI2164, to keep the 'legacy' device codes untouched

  As from V2.2.1:
   Adding INDIRECT_I2C_CONNECTION control, allowing tuner i2c connection via any demodulator.
    This is used for applications with multiple demodulators
    Adding SiLabs_API_SAT_Tuner_I2C_Enable, SiLabs_API_SAT_Tuner_I2C_Disable,
           SiLabs_API_TER_Tuner_I2C_Enable, SiLabs_API_TER_Tuner_I2C_Disable
      These functions are used for INDIRECT_I2C_CONNECTION control
   SILABS_TER_TUNER_API compatibility (the only way to work with Si2164):
    Adding SiLabs_API_Select_TER_Tuner function, useful to select the TER tuner for each demodulator
    Adding SiLabs_API_TER_Address function, useful to set the I2C address of any TER tuner
    Adding SiLabs_API_TER_Clock and SiLabs_API_SAT_Clock functions, to configure the clock paths (source, input, freq).
     NB: This only works if matching functions are added to the demodulator code.
     NB: In this first version, these functions only support SI2164, to keep the 'legacy' device codes untouched
   In SiLabs_API_TER_Tuner_ATV_Text_status: not implemented for SILABS_TER_TUNER_API (not sure it was ever used)
   In SiLabs_API_Demod_status: tracing front_end->chip code also in hexadecimal.

  As from V2.2.0:
   In SiLabs_API_SAT_Unicable_Install:
    For Si2167: Using ds_sequence_mode 'manual' to select 'no_gap' sequences in Unicable mode
   In SiLabs_API_SAT_Unicable_Uninstall:
    For Si2167: Using ds_sequence_mode 'auto' to select 'gap' sequences in Normal mode

  As from V2.1.9:
   In SiLabs_API_SAT_voltage, for LNBH25 (as this part requires an init):
    if (front_end->lnb_chip_init_done == 0) { front_end->lnb_chip_init_done = L1_LNBH25_InitAfterReset(front_end->lnbh25); }
   Adding SiLabs_API_SAT_Unicable_Uninstall, to allow easily switching between NORMAL and UNICABLE modes
   In SiLabs_API_SAT_Unicable_Install:

   Adding SiLabs_API_SAT_Unicable_Uninstall, to allow easily switching between NORMAL and UNICABLE modes

  As from V2.1.7:
   Adding SiLabs_API_SAT_voltage and SiLabs_API_SAT_tone, to allow managing the voltage separately from the tone.
     This is mostly interesting for Unicable, where the tone is not used to select the band.
     It's used in the Unicable code as from 2013/03/14 (SVN3657) to save time when sending a Unicable message over the DiSEqC bus
   In SiLabs_API_SAT_prepare_diseqc_sequence:
     Adding Si2164/Si2167B/Si2169
   In SiLabs_API_SAT_trigger_diseqc_sequence:
     Adding Si2164/Si2167B/Si2169

  As from V2.1.6:
   Adding SiLabs_API_SAT_prepare_diseqc_sequence and SiLabs_API_SAT_trigger_diseqc_sequence, to allow preparing the DiSEqC
     message and sending it in two steps. This is required for Unicable with some demodulator (such as Si2167A), as
     otherwise the preparation takes too much time to stay within the Unicable Td specification (4 to 22 ms)
   In SiLabs_API_Demod_status:
    Added comments to differentiate the various status blocks
   In SiLabs_API_SW_Init:
    Adding initialization of two new functions for Unicable:

    Si2164: first statuses for DVB-C2 added
    Setting BER, PER for Si2185

  As from V2.1.3:
   Compatibility with Si2191
   In Silabs_UserInput_demod:
    Compatibility with Si2185
   In Silabs_API_Test:
   Init of num_data_slice, to avoid compilation warning when not used

  As from V2.1.2:
   Compatibility with Si2164 (first C2 chip):
    data_slice_id added as a parameter for 'lock_to_carrier'
    *num_data_slice' addes as a parameter for 'Seek_Next'
   Adding SiLabs_API_SSI_SQI function (for S/S2 reception only)
   In SiLabs_API_Demod_status:
    Correcting status->uncorrs for all API controlled demodulators: '(uncor_msb<<8) + uncor_lsb' instead of '(uncor_msb<<16) + uncor_lsb'
   In SiLabs_API_SAT_Unicable_Tune:
    Removing one printf
   In SiLabs_API_lock_to_carrier:
    Correcting voltage levels for SAT polarization selection:
     13V is for 'Vertical', 18V is for 'Horizontal'
    Removing copy of front_end polarization and band values to Unicable structure
    (these may use different values)
   In SiLabs_API_Channel_Seek_Next:
    Removing Unicable polarization and band setup (the reference valeus are those in the front_end structure)
   In SiLabs_API_SAT_voltage_and_tone:
     Correcting voltage levels for SAT polarization selection:
     13V is for 'Vertical', 18V is for 'Horizontal'
   In Silabs_API_Test:
    Initializing all variables to avoid warnings when not used
    Adding access to test pipe for Si2165D
    Adding sat_scan_unicable option

   Setting status->cell_id by default at 0.
   Updating status->cell_id for Si2165, Si2167 and Si2167B
  In SiLabs_API_lock_to_carrier:
   Tracing input parameters with the corresponding names

  As from V2.1.0:
  In SiLabs_API_Demod_status:
   Calling SAT_TUNER_RSSI_FROM_IFAGC if it exists
  In SiLabs_API_SAT_Tuner_status:
   Removed duplicate call to SiLabs_API_Tuner_I2C_Enable

  As from V2.0.9:
  In SiLabs_API_Demod_status:
   For Si2165D:
    status->spectral_inversion = Si2165_L1_DVB_T_get_spectral_inversion (front_end->Si2165_FE->demod);
   For Si2167:
    status->spectral_inversion = Si2167_L1_DVB_T_get_spectral_inversion (front_end->Si2167_FE->demod);
   For Si2169:
    removing duplicate status->num_plp = ... line
  In SiLabs_API_Text_status:
    Comparing 'float' ratios with signed int values using (signed int) cast
  In SiLabs_API_Channel_Seek_Next:
    *num_plp     = 0; (the previous code, without the '*', 'erased' the pointer...)
  In Silabs_API_Test:
   Adding easy access to VDAPPS functions (for internal use)

  As from V2.0.8:
   Adding SiLabs_API_Get_DVBT_Hierarchy function, to retrieve the hiearchy information from the wrapper
   In SiLabs_API_TER_Tuner_status & SiLabs_API_SAT_Tuner_status:
    Moving lines for compatibility with VisualStudio (all variables need to be declared before any one is used).
    Without this it can be quite complex to debug, as the compiler message is not really explicit.
   In SiLabs_API_bytes_trace:
    Corrected when trackWrite flag was sent twice, instead of setting trackWrite & trackRead.
   In SiLabs_API_SAT_voltage_and_tone:
    Tracing voltage and tone values

  As from V2.0.7:
   Compatibility with LNBH29
   In SiLabs_API_Channel_Seek_Next:
    Compatibility with 'handshake' feature
   In SiLabs_API_SW_Init:
     Using a compilation flag to set the LNBH controller chip address if not defined at project level.
     It is written to allow the LNBH_I2C_ADDRESS flag to be defined at project level.
     If not defined at project level, it defaults to '#define LNBH_I2C_ADDRESS 0x10'
   In SiLabs_API_SAT_voltage_and_tone:
     Displaying 'in Unicable Mode' trace only when in Unicable mode.
   In SiLabs_API_Channel_Seek_Init: improved function comments

  As from V2.0.6:
   In SiLabs_API_Demod_status:
    For Si2165D:
     status->IFagc = Si2165_L1_Demod_get_IFagc        (front_end->Si2165_FE->demod);
     (previously returning aci_agc_cmd)
    For Si2169:
     Calling Si2169_L1_DVBT2_TX_ID
     status->cell_id            = front_end->Si2169_FE->demod->rsp->dvbt2_tx_id.cell_id;

  As from V2.0.5:
   LNBH init correction:
   In SiLabs_API_SW_Init, front_end->lnb_chip_init_done = 0; to force the flag at '0'.
    (Some compilers may set it randomly, so it needs to be forced to '0' for compatibility reasons.)

  As from V2.0.4:
   ADDED FEATURE: Added SiLabs_API_Channel_Lock_Abort function, to allow aborting a call to SiLabs_API_lock_to_carrier.

  As from V2.0.2:
   In SiLabs_API_Select_PLP:
    For Si2169: if (plp_mode == Si2169_DVBT2_PLP_SELECT_CMD_PLP_ID_SEL_MODE_AUTO) { Si2169_L1_DD_RESTART(front_end->Si2169_FE->demod); system_wait(300); }

  As from V2.0.1:
   Added lnb_chip_init_done in SILABS_FE_Context
   In SiLabs_API_SAT_voltage_and_tone:
    if (front_end->lnb_chip_init_done == 0) { front_end->lnb_chip_init_done = L1_LNBH25_InitAfterReset(front_end->lnbh25); }
    This is because the LNBH25 requires an init of all registers

  As from V2.0.0:
   In SiLabs_API_Text_status:
    sprintf(formatted_status, "%s TS bitrate       %d kbps\n", status->TS_bitrate_kHz);

     Set to 0 all info used to relock (bandwidth_Hz, symbol_rate, stream, constellation)
   In SiLabs_API_switch_to_standard:
     For Si2169: Checking dd_status.modulation if switch_to_standard fails
   In SiLabs_API_lock_to_carrier:
     Returning 0 if switch_to_standard fails

  As from 1.5.1:
        power_of_n corrected to return the proper value
